# Linear Regression - A brief introduction

The problem of linear regression basically deals with fitting a hypothetical **function** to a real life data set. In Statistics, this problem is dealt with few assumptions about the underlying data set,
but the core algorithm remains same. In machine learning, it comes under the hood of **Supervised Learning**, where there two types of variables viz. *predictor* and *target*. Our first task is to
identify the functional relationship (if any) between target and predictor(s) and then to estimate the parameters of the functional form with the help of given data. Estimation of parameters is known
as **fitting**.  
  
In this tutorial, we only deal with linear functional forms between target and predictor variables. If we have $$p$$
